# CuteCom QML Mockup

This is a non functional mockup of how a newer version of CuteCom could be implemented using QML and QtQuick for the layout.

At the moment, quite a few flaws are visible. 

The main idea of the draft is to get the serial device's settings out of the way and maximise the room for input and output.
Therefor a control panel sliding in out and from and to the top was introduced.
The rest of interface is more or less a copy of the original's UI.
